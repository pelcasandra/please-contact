# please-contact

Hello. I coudln't find a way to contact you so I choosed this method. 

I noticied you own the @asegura handle in Github and its profile has no activity.

We have a company with the same name and we would like to explore the possibility to get this handle to host our public repos.

Please drop me an email to pelcasandra@me.com to discuss it. 

Thanks,
Martin
